   - User selects document type (invoice/quote/receipt)
   - System generates sequential document number based on type prefix
   - User selects or creates client information
   - User adds line items with descriptions, quantities, and prices
   - System calculates subtotals, taxes, and final totals
   - Document is saved to database and PDF is generated client-side

2. **Business Configuration**:
   - Admin configures business details, branding, and document settings
   - Settings are stored in BusinessSettings model
   - Currency and tax rate configurations affect all document calculations

3. **Client Management**:
   - CRUD operations for client records
   - Client data is used to populate document recipient information
   - Integration with document generator for seamless workflow

## External Dependencies

### Backend Dependencies
- **Flask**: Web framework
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: Database ORM
- **Werkzeug**: WSGI utilities and proxy fix for deployment

### Frontend Dependencies (CDN-based)
- **Bootstrap 5**: UI framework with dark theme
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library
- **jsPDF**: Client-side PDF generation library

### Database Support
- **SQLite**: Default development database
- **PostgreSQL**: Production database support with automatic URL conversion

## Deployment Strategy

The application is designed for easy deployment with the following considerations:

1. **Environment Configuration**:
   - DATABASE_URL environment variable for database connection
   - SESSION_SECRET for Flask session security
   - Automatic PostgreSQL URL format conversion

2. **Database Initialization**:
   - Automatic table creation on application startup
   - Models define schema structure with proper relationships

3. **PWA Deployment**:
   - Service worker enables offline functionality
   - Manifest file allows installation as native app
   - Responsive design works across devices

4. **Static Asset Management**:
   - CDN-based external dependencies reduce bundle size
   - Local static files for custom functionality
   - Efficient caching strategy in service worker

5. **Production Considerations**:
   - ProxyFix middleware for proper header handling behind reverse proxies
   - Database connection pooling with recycle and ping settings
   - Configurable session secrets for security

The application architecture emphasizes simplicity, maintainability, and progressive enhancement, making it suitable for small to medium business document generation needs while providing professional-quality output.
